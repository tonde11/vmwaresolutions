# Migrating pre-V2.5 NetApp ONTAP Select instances to IBM Cloud accounts

NetApp ONTAP Select instances that are deployed in V2.5 and later releases in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account are automatically added to your account and are managed by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM).

For instances that were deployed in V2.4 and early releases, you can migrate them to specified {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} accounts for IAM-enabled user management.

## Before you begin

Ensure that the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account that you want to migrate the instance to is not an IaaS-only account. An IaaS-only account is an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure (IBM Cloud) account that is not linked to an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

For more information about how to link your Iaas-only account to your PaaS account, see [Follow these steps to link your IaaS and PaaS accounts](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/03/follow-steps-link-iaas-paas-accounts/).

## Procedure to migrate instances

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Deployed Instances** on the left navigation pane.
2. From the console banner, click your user account icon, and then click the **Account** field to select the user account that you want to migrate the instance to.
3. In the **NetApp ONTAP Select Instances** table, find the pre-V2.5 instance.
4. In the **Actions** column, click the overflow menu icon, and then click **Migrate Instance to Account**.
5. In the **Migrate Instance to Account** window, confirm the account to migrate the instance to, and then click **Migrate**.

## Results

1. You get a console notification that your request to migrate the instance to the specified {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account is accepted.
2. When the instance migration is completed, the instance is displayed on the **Deployed Instances** page under the account that it is migrated in to. The migrated instance is no longer displayed in the original account from which it was migrated.
